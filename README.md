# Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the **leading cause of death globally**, accounting for nearly **17.9 million deaths annually**, with **heart failure** being one of the most prevalent and deadly outcomes. Early detection and intervention are crucial for at-risk individuals, such as those with hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia. This project utilizes the **Heart Failure Prediction dataset**, sourced from Kaggle, to build machine learning models that accurately predict the presence of heart disease.

---

## Project Aim

The goal of this project is to **develop and compare four machine learning algorithms** to classify whether a patient has heart disease (label: 1) or not (label: 0), using a variety of clinical measurements and indicators.

We aim to provide **reliable, data-driven models** that healthcare professionals can potentially integrate into clinical workflows. Each model is fairly trained and evaluated on the same dataset splits to ensure a meaningful comparison.

---

## Objectives

- âœ… Conduct comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- âœ… Preprocess and clean the dataset (handle duplicates, encode categorical variables, scale features).
- âœ… Build and evaluate the following machine learning models:
  - **Logistic Regression** using `statsmodels`
  - **Random Forest Classifier** using `scikit-learn`
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Decision Tree**
- âœ… Compare model performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC**.
- âœ… Visualize model results and insights for better interpretability.

## Dataset Details

**Source**: [Kaggle â€“ Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

The dataset is a **consolidation of five major heart disease datasets**, cleaned and deduplicated to result in **918 final observations**.
